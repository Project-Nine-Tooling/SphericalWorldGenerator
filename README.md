# Spherical World Generator

Date: 2025-07-26

Based on Jon's [WorldGeneratorFinal](https://github.com/jongallant/WorldGeneratorFinal), as per its article on [procedural world generation](https://www.jgallant.com/procedurally-generating-wrapping-world-maps-in-unity-csharp-part-4/). Organized and stripped Unity related logic. Proceedings from this will likely be used in The Matrix.

Notice his algorithm is very similar to how Minecraft works, especially for the climate part.
